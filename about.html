		<h2>About</h2>
		
		<p>This research project aims to improve the design of websites and tools that make personal genomic information more accessible and understandable by the general public.

		<p>In the first stage of this research project, we seek to learn more about how users of personal genomics engage with and learn from their information.  Thus, we look for volunteers who have already received their own personal genomic data and are willing to help us understand their goals and means of engaging with personal genomic information.

		<p>More specifically, we will ask participants to walk us through their information workflow as they explore their own personal genomic information. In addition, we will discuss with participants their sharing preferences, motivations, and concerns regarding sharing, and the impact that sharing information had on their lives. 

		<p>The time required for participating in this study is about 30 minutes.
