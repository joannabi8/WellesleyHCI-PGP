		<h2>About</h2>
		
		<p>This research project aims to improve the design of websites and tools that make personal genomic information more accessible and understandable by the general public.</p>

		<p>We seek to learn more about how users, who are non-experts in genetics, can engage and learn from personal genomic information.</p> 

		<p>In this survey, we will ask you to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>read about personal genomics and take a brief quiz about the information;</li>
			<li>explore a personal genomic report of a user named Jamie and answer questions about the report;</li>
			<li>answer some demographic questions;</li>
		</ol>

		<p> The time required for participating in this study is about 20 minutes.</p>
