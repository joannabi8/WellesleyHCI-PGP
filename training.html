	<p>Please read over the following information carefully. Then complete the quiz below.</p>

	<h2>What is a genome?</h2>
	<p>Your genome contains the set of instructions needed to make every cell, tissue, and organ in your body.
	The biological information contained in a genome is encoded in <b>DNA</b> (deoxyribonucleic acid) and
	divided into discrete units known as <b>genes</b>.

	All humans have the same set of genes and our genomes are over 99% identical. We can trace the differences
	we observe between people to slight variations in these genes. A <b>gene variant</b> is a specific form of a
	gene that a person carries as determined by its DNA sequence. For example, the major blood types, A, B, and O,
	are determined through the gene variants a  person carries for the ABO gene. Particular gene variants may
	be associated with medical conditions. <b>Allele frequency</b> is a measure of how common a particular variant
	is in the population. The more common a gene variant is, the less likely it is to be cause for serious concern.

	Our DNA alone, however, does not determine who we are. Personal behaviors, access to quality health care,
	the general external environmental (such as the quality of air, water, and housing conditions), as well as
	social and cultural factors all have an impact on our health.</p>


	<h2>What is personal genomics?</h2>
	<p>Personal genomics information is generated by reading all or parts of the DNA in an individual's genome and
	analyzing it. Some genes code for traits that we can observe, such as height, and hair and eye color. Other
	genes may affect us in less obvious ways, such as the genes that predispose individuals to Type 2 Diabetes.

	Cutting edge scientific technologies are quickly making it faster and less expensive to learn about our own DNA.
	Today, direct-to-consumer (DTC) test are available to consumers. Such tests require only a small biological
	sample to report information that might be predicted by the sequence of your DNA. Such tests usually involve
	collecting a DNA sample at home, often by swabbing the inside of the cheek, and mailing the sample back to the 
	laboratory. In some cases, the person must visit a health clinic to have blood drawn.

	Amongst other applications, <b>personal genomics may be used to</b>:
	<ul><li>Calculate your risk for developing particular health conditions</li>
		<li>Determine how particular drugs may work for you</li>
		<li>Explore your ancestry and family history</li>
	</ul>
